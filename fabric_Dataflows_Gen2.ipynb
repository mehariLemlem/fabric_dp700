    "- In Power BI Desktop, you can connect directly to the data transformations done with your dataflow by using the Power BI dataflows (Legacy) connector. You can also make additional transformations, publish as a new dataset, and distribute with intended audience for specialized datasets.\n",
    "- You can split dataflows by data slices (like region or year), and once you have a central trusted dataflow, analysts can build smaller, customized models from it without re-creating the data from scratch.\n",
    "- In Fabric, a global dataflow provides standardized enterprise data, and horizontal partitioning lets us split it by region, year, or business unit. Analysts then build specialized semantic models from the global dataflow instead of pulling from raw systems, which improves performance, governance, and consistency.\n",
    "- Dataflows Gen2 simplifies ingestion and transformation in Fabric by writing curated data directly to OneLake and enabling reuse across teams. It works best for batch-based, low-code ETL and semantic model preparation, but it’s not suitable for real-time processing, very large-scale transformations, or complex DevOps-driven workloads."
